Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where models inspired by how our brain works are expressed mathematically, and the parameters defining the mathematical models, which can be in the order of few thousands to 100+ million, are learned automatically from the data.</p>\r\n<p>Deep learning is a key enabler of AI powered technologies being developed across the globe. In this deep learning course, you will learn an intuitive approach to building complex models that help machines solve real-world problems with human-like intelligence. The intuitive approaches will be translated into working code with practical problems and hands-on experience. You will learn how to build and derive insights from these models using Python Jupyter notebooks running on your local Windows or Linux machine, or on a virtual machine running on Azure. Alternatively, you can leverage the Microsoft Azure Notebooks platform for free.</p>\r\n<p>This course provides the level of detail needed to enable engineers / data scientists / technology managers to develop an intuitive understanding of the key concepts behind this game changing technology. At the same time, you will learn simple yet powerful &ldquo;motifs&rdquo; that can be used with lego-like flexibility to build an end-to-end deep learning model. You will learn how to use the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit &mdash; previously known as CNTK &mdash; to harness the intelligence within massive datasets through deep learning with uncompromised scaling, speed, and accuracy.<br /><br />edX offers financial assistance for learners who want to earn Verified Certificates but who may not be able to pay the fee.

                    "Description": "Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from computer systems to physics. Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines, recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), advertisers, and financial institutions employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation, predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk.<br /><br />As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer programs that learn from experience for the purpose of prediction or control.&nbsp; <br /><br />In this course, students will learn about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions.&nbsp; We will cover:<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;</li>\r\n<li>Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;</li>\r\n<li>On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nStudents will implement and experiment with the algorithms in several Python projects designed for different practical applications.<br /><br /><strong>This course is part of the <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MITx MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science</a>. Master the skills needed to be an informed and effective practitioner of data science. You will complete this course and three others from MITx, at a similar pace and level of rigor as an on-campus course at MIT, and then take a virtually-proctored exam to earn your MicroMasters, an academic credential that will demonstrate your proficiency in data science or accelerate your path towards an MIT PhD or a Master's at other universities.

You’ll learn the models and methods and apply them to real world situations ranging from identifying trending news topics, to building recommendation engines, ranking sports teams and plotting the path of movie zombies.</p>\n<p>Major perspectives covered include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>probabilistic versus non-probabilistic modeling</li>\n<li>supervised versus unsupervised learning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topics include: classification and regression, clustering methods, sequential models, matrix factorization, topic modeling and model selection.</p>\n<p>Methods include: linear and logistic regression, support vector machines, tree classifiers, boosting, maximum likelihood and MAP inference, EM algorithm, hidden Markov models, Kalman filters, k-means, Gaussian mixture models, among others.</p>\n<p>In the first half of the course we will cover supervised learning techniques for regression and classification. In this framework, we possess an output or response that we wish to predict based on a set of inputs. We will discuss several fundamental methods for performing this task and algorithms for their optimization. Our approach will be more practically motivated, meaning we will fully develop a mathematical understanding of the respective algorithms, but we will only briefly touch on abstract learning theory.</p>\n<p>In the second half of the course we shift to unsupervised learning techniques. In these problems the end goal less clear-cut than predicting an output based on a corresponding input. We will cover three fundamental problems of unsupervised learning: data clustering, matrix factorization, and sequential models for order-dependent data. Some applications of these models include object recommendation and topic modeling.</p>",
